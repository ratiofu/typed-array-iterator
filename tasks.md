- [x] 0. Refactor `useSearch` so that the stream work is complete before the item is rendered  
- [x] 1. Provide a "debug" option for any of the terminals to emit the resulting source code 
- [ ] 2. Remove all iterable support from the Stream and compiler; no need to branch or check in code: assume arraylike and enforce via types 
- [ ] 3. Remove count/length and provide an `estimateSize` option that samples the source if filters exist 
- [ ] 4. Revisit the benchmark implementation to be more real-world focused and investigate performance regressions
- [ ] 5. Add more comprehensive unit tests for complex combinations of ops
- [ ] 6. Address [multi-range-support](./multi-range-support.md)
